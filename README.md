# CVML â€“ CV Markup Language

The CVML (Curriculum Vitae Markup Language) is a language to describe your CV.
You can then build upon this language to create great tools.

# How can I use it?

Using CVML is pretty simple, with this repository a schema file (RELAX NG) is
published that you can easily use to validate files against using tools like
`xmllint`.

To check for validity of a file using `xmllint` use the following command (this
command actually works when used in the root of this repository):

```bash
xmllint --noout --relaxng src/cvml.rng tests/pass/example.xml
# change to your own file:             ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
```

# Why not XSD?

XSD is huge and complicated, that is the reason why e.g. `xmllint` supports RNG
better than XSD.
You can also transpile RNG to XSD if you really want to.

# Roadmap

- [ ] create RELAX NG schema
- [ ] automatically generate XSD from RNG
- [ ] build tools
	- [ ] CV generator
	- [ ] CV editor
